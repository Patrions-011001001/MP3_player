Hello dear friends!
I present to you my new mp3 player. On this version, the following functions are available to the user: 

    Listening to music, 
    a playlist for switching tracks regardless of the order, 
    a function for leaving an emotional position about a track, 
    selective repetition (the entire playlist, one track or stopping switching to the next track).
    
Some of the features I can only leave the best for now so feel free to report bugs.
Enjoy listening, I will be very grateful if you support me with money.(2200 7302 5480 9300)ðŸ˜š.
